          Civil engineering is considered to be the oldest branch of
          engineering. It is the application of physical and scientific
          principles for solving the problems of society. In civil engineering
          one gains the knowledge about structures, material science, geography,
          geology, soils, hydrology, environment, mechanics and many more. Civil
          engineering is the application of mechanics and physics which helps
          civil engineers to go beyond the imaginations and build structures.

          The department of civilengineering is dedicated to the growth of students and department
          as well. The faculty and staff are always keen to help students for
          their queries. The department
          aims to work for the welfare of society as well.The course outline of civil field programmes gives
          the fundamental knowledge and flexibility as it has different types of
          work to do like designing,
          surveying and maintaining a structure,as well as it provides a better future for civil engineers.The
          principle educational objective of our department is to provide the
          students with fundamental and high tech knowledge and the skills
          needed to resolve the problems related to construction and maintenance
