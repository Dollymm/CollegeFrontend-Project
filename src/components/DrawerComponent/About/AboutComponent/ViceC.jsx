      <h3>Dr. Onkar Singh</h3>
      <Typography>
        My dear students and esteemed colleagues, <br/>At the very onset, I am
        prompted to use a John Dewey’s quote: “Education is not preparation for
        life; education is life itself”.
        <br/>
         My hearty welcome to you to join
        Institute of Technology (IT) Gopeshwar, a splendid Temple of Learning
        which is a constituent college of Uttarakhand Technical University
        (UTU). Choosing an Institution has been one of the most important
        decisions of your life. You are entering into the arena of higher
        education where the future is full of opportunities. I would like to
        congratulate you on choosing IT, Gopeshwar as an Institution in
        developing your career and realising dreams.<br/>
         Education is about much
        more than employability. It includes evolving with a different view,
        developing different perspectives and opening your mind to the enormous
        possibilities, and ultimately emerging as world class human resource.
        The University and IT offer you an intellectually challenging and
        rewarding atmosphere. It gives you the ability, self-confidence and the
        desire to go on learning for the rest of your life and to cope with new
        emerging and challenging situations. We at the University and IT are
        firmly committed to excel in technical education and research, and are
        fully aware of the challenges of the future. Apart from strengthening
        the teaching-learning process, research and extension programmes,
        special focus on extra-curricular, sports and other similar activities
        to foster global competencies among the students is our priority.
        <br/> The
        University and ITG aim at facilitating and promoting studies, research,
        technology incubation, product innovation and extension work in Science
        and Technology for achieving excellence in higher technical education.
        We provide a congenial environment for the holistic growth and all round
        development of the students through suitably designed teaching learning
        processes.<br/> Society is changing rapidly in many ways which will have a
        profound impact on the roles of Universities. In this changing world,
        knowledge will remain a key resource around the globe. The dynamics of
        the fast-changing world urges the academicians to give the right impetus
        for making life-long learners out of students. The horizons of
        professional activities are expanding, and hence today there is a
        greater scope for the students to present their talents and
        achievements. Since technical education in our country has become quite
        dynamic and competitive, we have to be ready and equipped with the
        required abilities and capacities to acquire the latest knowledge
        through newer technology. <br/>I welcome all the students who chose to be a
        part of this premier Institute (IT), I am sure that you will feel proud
        on being associated with us and make us equally proud with your academic
        excellence and accomplishments.
