              A quality universal primary education will remain a distant dream
              for millions of students living in countries without enough
              trained teachers in classrooms. Teachers are the core of any
              education system. Hiring and training new and already established
              teachers is fundamental to protecting students' ability to learn
              in college. Teachers are the core of any education system. Hiring

              A classroom is a learning space, a room in which classes are held.
              The key element in classroom management, whether using technology
              or not, is to ensure that students are actively participating in
              the learning process, not simply receiving it. There are many new
              technological advances that can be found in todayâ€™s classrooms,
              and the integration of technology into classrooms has brought
              learning to an entirely new level.
