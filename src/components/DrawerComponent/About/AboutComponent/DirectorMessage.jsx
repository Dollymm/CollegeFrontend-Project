<h4>My Dear Students</h4>
    
      <Typography>
       I take this opportunity to introduce Institute
        of Technology, Gopeshwar (ITG) to the student’s community. It is time to
        realize that the finest society can be developed by using creative minds
        in the advanced areas of Science and Engineering. In that spirit, we
        have come up with this engineering institute where girls and boys are
        being groomed to reach the pinnacle of success. We are proud of your
        association with the institute which will help in spreading the
        technical education in this region. ITG is focused to create an
        environment of the total development of students at different levels
        viz. intellectual, emotional & social. My hearty welcome to you to join
        Institute of Technology (IT) Gopeshwar, a splendid Temple of Learning
        which is a VMSB Uttarakhand Technical University (UTU) campus Institute.
        Choosing an Institution has been one of the most important decisions of
        your life. You are entering into the arena of higher education where the
        future is full of opportunities. I would like to congratulate you on
        choosing IT, Gopeshwar as an Institution in developing your career and
        realising dreams. ITG offers B. Tech programme in five disciplines viz.
        CSE, ECE, ME, CE, and EE. We at ITG strive to provide congenial academic
        environment by combining education with overall personality development.
        We have planned to introduce a number of add-on courses to develop an
        engineer in totality with his/her mind and body as perfect tools for
        specific career absorptions. Academic excellence is our priority. We are
        determined to have a close tie up and linkages with major Industrial
        Houses. We involve our students right from the beginning, on short and
        long term basis, for exhaustive training and industrial project work. It
        facilitates hands-on experience in real technological aspects and skill
        development. I would like to sign-off my message with the words of Mr.
        Winston Churchill,
        <br/>
        “Success is not final;
failure is not fatal;
it is the courage to continue that counts”
With best wishes,
